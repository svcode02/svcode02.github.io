This project was my senior thesis project about the emotional and mental health benefits of tea. It consists of a trio of zines that illustrate how tea can connect people to each other and their culture, as well as reduce stress and increase mindfulness in todayâ€™s overstimulating world. All of this was done after research, a competitor analysis, and creating a unique visual language to be used across the entire project.&nbsp;
