# Hi, I'm Sara.

I'm a graphic and web designer from Long Island, New York! I've been designing for over 3 years and have a strong background in branding, digital, and web design. Despite the hardships of the pandemic, I decided to pursue a BFA in Graphic Design at SUNY New Paltz in 2020. Since then, I have worked with local and student organizations, my college's design department, and a talented team of open-source software developers. When I'm not designing, I am creating a new tea blend, going on a nature walk, or crocheting.
